This is a good script but I am using a faster way using Pandoc. I simply bound a macro command in order to have the file converted to html before sending.

macro compose \e5 “F pandoc -s -f markdown -t html \ny^T^Utext/html; charset=utf-8\n”

We should be able to grab the GAL (global address list)
looks like this is a possible payload to request it:
